#Getting Started
[Project Github Link:](https://github.com/samuelboediono/MSFGA)

Users can create an account via their Google account. If an account already exists for a user, they can log in using their Google credentials. Once logged in, users arrive on the dashboard page where they can see a map of all active volunteer events and a list of the corresponding events below. Selecting the button on the top right of the page causes the sidebar to slide-out. In the menu, users can access the following pages: profile, create event, view event or logout. The profile page displays the user's profile name as well as the points they have accumulated. The create events page allows a user to create a new event which will appear on the dashboard page.
