#Overview

We created resQSF because there is a dire need to improve our beautiful city. The government isn't doing anything and tech companies that generate billions are evading taxes left and right. For this reason, we banded together to develop an app that can let us improve be city ourselves. With ResQSF, users can organize and sign up for volunteer events

#Getting Started
[Project Github Link:](https://github.com/samuelboediono/MSFGA)

Users can create an account via their Google account. If an account already exists for a user, they can log in using their Google credentials. Once logged in, users arrive on the dashboard page where they can see a map of all active volunteer events and a list of the corresponding events below. Selecting the button on the top right of the page causes the sidebar to slide-out. In the menu, users can access the following pages: profile, create event, view event or logout. The profile page displays the user's profile name as well as the points they have accumulated. The create events page allows a user to create a new event which will appear on the dashboard page.
